# 📱 STUDENT DASHBOARD - MOBILE RESPONSIVE FIX IN PROGRESS

## ⚠️ **Important Note:**

I'm currently fixing the Student Dashboard to make it fully mobile responsive. The file is large with 10+ sections that need responsive breakpoints.

## ✅ **Sections Fixed So Far:**

1. ✅ Header Section - Responsive text
2. ✅ Stats Cards - 1 → 2 → 4 columns
3. ✅ Quick Actions - 2 → 3 columns

## 🔄 **Sections Being Fixed:**

4. Recent Grades
5. Average Display
6. Upcoming Assignments
7. Rank Card
8. Upcoming Tests
9. Study Materials
10. Achievement Banner

## 📱 **Strategy:**

Making all sections responsive with:
- Responsive grids (1 → 2 → 3/4 columns)
- Responsive text (text-3xl → 5xl)
- Responsive padding (p-6 → p-8)
- Responsive spacing (gap-4 → gap-6)
- Stack on mobile (flex-col → flex-row)

## 🚀 **Will Complete Soon:**

Applying mobile responsive patterns to all remaining sections...
